# Smart Pantry Scan

This project is an inventory management application for your pantry.

## Current Status

The project is currently undergoing a refactoring. The original React Native application has been moved to the `old_react_native` directory. A new React Native application is being developed in the `react_Native` directory, and a web application is planned in the `webApp` directory.

## Future Plans

The long-term vision for this project is to move away from traditional barcode scanning for item identification. Instead, the goal is to implement a system that uses a device's camera and a local, on-device Large Language Model (LLM) to recognize and add items to the inventory.

## Project Structure

*   `/react_Native`: Contains the current Android application built with React Native.
*   `/old_react_native`: Contains the previous version of the React Native application.
*   `/webApp`: Will contain the web application version of the pantry scanner.
